About This Project

Welcome to my libft project! This repository showcases my own implementation of the foundational libft library from the renowned 42 curriculum. In this project, I have developed a comprehensive set of C library functions, mirroring many standard C functions as well as additional helper functions commonly used in programming projects.
Key Features:

    Standard C Library Functions: My libft includes core functions such as strlen(), strcpy(), and atoi(), providing a robust foundation for C programming.

    Custom Utility Functions: In addition to standard functions, my implementation offers a range of utility functions designed to streamline common programming tasks, such as memory management and string manipulation.

    Quality and Consistency: My approach to libft emphasizes high-quality code and consistency across the project, ensuring code is clear, efficient, and maintainable.

By creating my own libft library, I aim to leverage the foundational concepts from 42's libft while introducing my own perspective and approach. This project serves as a valuable exercise in mastering core programming concepts and producing reusable code.

For more information on the original 42 libft library, you can visit the GitHub repository here.

Thank you for exploring my libft project. I hope you find it useful and insightful!
